Abstract
In a risky world, a pessimist assumes the worst will happen. Someone who ignores risk
altogether is an optimist. Consumption decisions are mathematically simple for both the
pessimist and the optimist because both behave as if they live in a riskless world. A realist
(that is, someone who wants to respond optimally to risk) faces a much more difficult problem,
but (under standard conditions) will choose a spending somewhere between pessimist’s and
the optimist’s. We use this fact to redefine the space in which the realist searches for optimal
consumption rules. The resulting solution accurately represents the numerical consumption
rule over the entire interval of feasible wealth values with remarkably few computations.

1 Introduction
Solving a consumption, investment, portfolio choice, or similar intertemporal optimization problem using numerical methods generally requires the modeler to choose how to
represent a policy or value function. In the stochastic case, where analytical solutions are
generally not available, a common approach is to use low-order polynominal splines that
exactly match the function (and maybe some derivatives) at a finite set of gridpoints,
and then to assume that interpolated or extrapolated versions of that spline represent
the function well at the continuous infinity of unmatched points.
This paper argues that a better approach in the standard consumption problem is
to rely upon the fact that without uncertainty, the optimal consumption function has
a simple analytical solution. The key insight is that, under standard assumptions, the
consumer who faces an uninsurable labor income risk will consume less than a consumer
with the same path for expected income but who does not perceive any uncertainty
as being attached to that future income. The ‘realistic’ consumer, who does perceive
the risks, will engage in ‘precautionary saving,’ so the perfect foresight riskless solution
provides an upper bound to the solution that will actually be optimal. A lower bound
is provided by the behavior of a consumer who has the subjective belief that the future
level of income will be the worst that it can possibly be. This consumer, too, behaves
according to the convenient analytical perfect foresight solution, but his certainty is that
of a pessimist perfectly confident in his pessimism.
Using results from Carroll (Forthcoming), we show how to use these upper and lower
bounds to tightly constrain the shape and characteristics of the solution to problem of
the ‘realist.’ Imposition of these constraints can clarify and speed the solution of the
realist’s problem.
After showing how to use the method in the baseline case, we show how refine it to
encompass an even tighter theoretical bound.

2 The Realist’s Problem
We assume that truly optimal behavior in the problem facing the consumer who understands all his risks is captured by

bt+1 − ‘bank balances’ (nonhuman wealth) at the beginning of t + 1
ct − consumption in period t
mt − ‘market resources’ available for consumption (‘cash-on-hand’)
p t+1 − ‘permanent labor income’ in period t + 1
Rt+1 − interest factor (1 + rt+1 ) from period t to t + 1
yt+1 − noncapital income in period t + 1.
and the exogenous variables evolve according to

(6)

It turns out (see Carroll (2014) for a proof) that this problem can be rewritten in a
more convenient form in which choice and state variables are normalized by the level
of permanent income, e.g., using nonbold font for normalized variables, mt = ct /ppt .
When that is done, the Bellman equation for the transformed version of the consumer’s
problem is

s.t.

≡Rt+1

and because we have not imposed a liquidity constraint, the solution satisfies the Euler
equation
0
u0 (ct ) = Et [βRΓ−ρ
t+1 u (ct+1 )].

(8)

For the remainder of the paper we will assume that permanent income p t grows by
a constant factor Γ and is not subject to stochastic shocks. (The generalization to the
case with permanent shocks is straightforward.)

3 Benchmark: The Method of Endogenous Gridpoints
For comparison to our new solution method, we use the endogenous gridpoints solution
to the microeconomic problem presented in Carroll (2006). That method computes the
level of consumption at a set of gridpoints for market resources m that are determined

endogenously using the Euler equation. The consumption function is then constructed
by linear interpolation among the gridpoints thus found.
Carroll (2014) describes a specific calibration of the model and constructs a solution
using five gridpoints chosen to capture the structure of the consumption function reasonably well at values of m near the infinite-horizon target value. (See those notes for
details).
Unfortunately, this endogenous gridpoints solution is not very well-behaved outside
the original range of gridpoints targeted by the solution method. (Though other common solution methods are no better outside their own predefined ranges). Figure 1
demonstrates the point by plotting the amount of precautionary saving implied by a
linear extrapolation of our approximated consumption rule (the consumption of the
perfect foresight consumer c̄T −1 minus our approximation to optimal consumption under uncertainty, c̀T −1 ). Although theory proves that precautionary saving is always
positive, the linearly extrapolated numerical approximation eventually predicts negative
precautionary saving (at the point in the figure where the extrapolated locus crosses the
horizontal axis).
This error cannot be fixed by extending the upper gridpoint; in the presence of serious
uncertainty, the consumption rule will need to be evaluated outside of any prespecified
grid (because starting from the top gridpoint, a large enough realization of the uncertain
variable will push next period’s realization of assets above that top; a similar argument
applies below the bottom gridpoint). While a judicious extrapolation technique can

4

prevent this problem from being fatal (for example by carefully excluding negative
precautionary saving), the problem is often dealt with using inelegant methods whose
implications for the accuracy of the solution are difficult to gauge.

4 The Method of Moderation
4.1 The Optimist, the Pessimist, and the Realist
4.1.1 The Consumption Function
As a preliminary to our solution, define ht as end-of-period human wealth (the present
discounted value of future labor income) for a perfect foresight version of the problem of
a ‘risk optimist:’ a consumer who believes with perfect confidence that the shocks will
always take the value 1, θt+n = E[θ] = 1 ∀ n > 0. The solution to a perfect foresight
problem of this kind takes the form1
c̄t (mt ) = (mt + ht )κt

(9)

for a constant minimal marginal propensity to consume κt given below. We similarly
define ht as ‘minimal human wealth,’ the present discounted value of labor income if the
shocks were to take on their worst possible value in every future period θt+n = θ ∀ n > 0
(which we define as corresponding to the beliefs of a ‘pessimist’).
A first useful point is that, for the realist, a lower bound for the level of market
resources is mt = −ht , because if mt equalled this value then there would be a positive
finite chance (however small) of receiving θt+n = θ in every future period, which would
require the consumer to set ct to zero in order to guarantee that the intertemporal budget
constraint holds. Since consumption of zero yields negative infinite utility, the solution
to realist consumer’s problem is not well defined for values of mt < mt , and the limiting
value of the realist’s ct is zero as mt ↓ mt .
Given this result, it will be convenient to define ‘excess’ market resources as the
amount by which actual resources exceed the lower bound, and ‘excess’ human wealth
as the amount by which mean expected human wealth exceeds guaranteed minimum
human wealth:
=−mt

z}|{
Nmt = mt + ht
Nht = ht − ht .
We can now transparently define the optimal consumption rules for the two perfect
foresight problems, those of the ‘optimist’ and the ‘pessimist.’ The ‘pessimist’ perceives
human wealth to be equal to its minimum feasible value ht with certainty, so consumption
is given by the perfect foresight solution
ct (mt ) = (mt + ht )κt
1 For a derivation, see Carroll (Forthcoming); κ is defined therein as the MPC of the perfect foresight consumer with

horizon T − t.

Figure 2 Moderation Illustrated: cT −1 < c̀T −1 < c̄T −1

The ‘optimist,’ on the other hand, pretends that there is no uncertainty about future
income, and therefore consumes
c̄t (mt ) = (mt + ht − ht + ht )κt
= (Nmt + Nht )κt
= ct (mt ) + Nht κt .
It seems obvious that the spending of the realist will be strictly greater than that of the
pessimist and strictly less than that of the optimist. Figure 2 illustrates the proposition
for the consumption rule in period T − 1.
Proof is more difficult than might be imagined, but the necessary work is done
in Carroll (Forthcoming) so we will take the proposition as a fact and proceed by
manipulating the inequality:
ct (mt + Nmt )
Nmt κt <
−Nmt κt >
−ct (mt + Nmt )
Nht κt >  c̄t (mt + Nmt ) − ct (mt + Nmt ) 

where the fraction in the middle of the last inequality is the ratio of actual precautionary

saving (the numerator is the difference between perfect-foresight consumption and optimal consumption in the presence of uncertainty) to the maximum conceivable amount
of precautionary saving (the amount that would be undertaken by the pessimist who
consumes nothing out of any future income beyond the perfectly certain component).
Defining µt = log Nmt (which can range from −∞ to ∞), the object in the middle of
the last inequality is

Because this method relies upon the fact that the problem is easy to solve if the decision maker has unreasonable views (either in the optimistic or the pessimistic direction),
and because the correct solution is always between these immoderate extremes, we call
our solution procedure the ‘method of moderation.’
Results are shown in Figure 3; a reader with very good eyesight might be able to
detect the barest hint of a discrepancy between the Truth and the Approximation at the
far righthand edge of the figure.
4.1.2 The Value Function
Although section ?? argued that our problem is more efficiently solved by constructing
the consumption rule than by approximating the value function, often it is useful to know
the value function as well as the consumption rule. Fortunately, many of the tricks used
when solving for the consumption rule have a direct analogue in approximation of the
value function.
Consider the perfect foresight (or “optimist’s”) problem in period T − 1:
v̄T −1 (mT −1 ) ≡ u(cT −1 ) + βu(cT )

This can be transformed as
Λ̄t

≡ ((1 − ρ)v̄t )1/(1−ρ)
= ct (CTt )1/(1−ρ)
−ρ/(1−ρ)

= (Nmt + Nht )κt

and since CTt is a constant while the consumption function is linear, Λ̄t will also be
linear.
We apply the same transformation to the value function for the problem with uncer-

tainty (the “realist’s” problem):
= ((1 − ρ)v̄t (mt ))1/(1−ρ)

Λ̄t

and an excellent approximation to the value function can be obtained by calculating the
values of Λ̄ at the same gridpoints used by the consumption function approximation, and
interpolating among those points.
However, as with the consumption approximation, we can do even better if we realize
that the Λ̄ function for the optimist’s problem is an upper bound for the Λ function in
the presence of uncertainty, and the value function for the pessimist is a lower bound.
Analogously to (10), define an upper-case

from which we obtain our approximation to the value function as
v̂t = u(Λ̂t )
v̂tm = u0 (Λ̂t )Λ̂m .
Although a linear interpolation that matches the level of Λ at the gridpoints is simple,
a Hermite interpolation that matches both the level and the derivative of the Λ̄t function
at the gridpoints has the considerable virtue that the v̄t derived from it numerically
satisfies the envelope theorem at each of the gridpoints for which the problem has been
solved.

5 Extensions
5.1 A Tighter Upper Bound
Carroll (Forthcoming) derives an upper limit κ̄t for the MPC as mt approaches its lower
bound. Using this fact plus the strict concavity of the consumption function yields the

9

proposition that
ct (mt + Nmt ) < κ̄t Nmt .

(23)

The solution method described above does not guarantee that approximated consumption will respect this constraint between gridpoints, and a failure to respect the
constraint can occasionally cause computational problems in solving or simulating the
model. Here, we describe a method for constructing an approximation that always
satisfies the constraint.
Defining m#
t as the ‘cusp’ point where the two upper bounds intersect:



t
Nm#
=

κt Nht

we want to construct a consumption function for mt ∈ (mt , m#
t ] that respects the tighter
upper bound:
ct (mt + Nmt )
< κ̄t Nmt
Nmt κt <
Nmt (κ̄t − κt ) > κ̄t
Nmt − ct (mt + Nm
 t) > 0
κ̄t Nmt −ct (mt +Nmt )
1>
> 0.
Nmt (κ̄t −κ )
t

Again defining µt = log Nmt , the object in the middle of the inequality is

ˇt (µt ) ≡

κ̄t − ct (mt + eµt )e−µt
.
κ̄t − κt

ˇt (µt ) converges to zero, while as mt approaches +∞, 
ˇt (µt )
As mt approaches −mt , 
approaches 1.
As before (in equation (??)), we can derive an approximated consumption function;
call it `čt . This function will clearly do a better job approximating the consumption
function for low values of mt while the previous approximation will perform better for
high values of mt .
For middling values of m it is not clear which of these functions will perform better.
However, an alternative is available which performs well. Define the highest gridpoint
#
#
¯#
below m#
t as m̌t and the lowest gridpoint above mt as m̂t . Then there will be a unique
interpolating polynomial that matches the level and slope of the consumption function
at these two points. Call this function c̃t (m).
Using indicator functions that are zero everywhere except for specified intervals,
¯#
1 Lo (m) = 1 if m ≤ m̌
t
#
¯
1 Mid (m) = 1 if
m̌#
t < m < m̂t
1 Hi (m) = 1 if
m̂#
t ≤ m

10

we can define a well-behaved approximating consumption function
c̀t = 1 Lo`čt + 1 Mid`c̃t + 1 Hi`ĉt .

(24)

This just says that, for each interval, we use the approximation that is most appropriate. The function is continuous and once-differentiable everywhere, and is therefore
well behaved for computational purposes.
We now construct an upper-bound value function implied for a consumer whose
spending behavior is consistent with the refined upper-bound consumption rule.
For mt ≥ m#
t , this consumption rule is the same as before, so the constructed upperbound value function is also the same. However, for values mt < m#
t matters are slightly
more complicated.
Start with the fact that at the cusp point,
#
T
v̄t (m#
t ) = u(c̄t (mt ))Ct
T
= u(Nm#
t κ̄t )Ct .

But for all mt ,
v̄t (m) = u(c̄t (m)) + v̄t (m − c̄t (m)),
and we assume that for the consumer below the cusp point consumption is given by
κ̄Nmt so for mt < m#
t
v̄t (m) = u(κ̄t Nm) + v̄t ((1 − κ̄t )Nm),
which is easy to compute because v̄t (at ) = βv̄t+1 (at R + 1) where v̄t is as defined
above because a consumer who ends the current period with assets exceeding the lower
bound will not expect to be constrained next period. (Recall again that we are merely
constructing an object that is guaranteed to be an upper bound for the value that the
‘realist’ consumer will experience.) At the gridpoints defined by the solution of the
consumption problem can then construct
= ((1 − ρ)v̄t (m))1/(1−ρ)
ˇ The rest of the procedure
which yields the appropriate vector for constructing X̌ and .
is analogous to that performed for the consumption rule and is thus omitted for brevity.
Λ̄t (m)

6 Conclusion
The method proposed here is not universally applicable. For example, the method
cannot be used for problems for which upper and lower bounds to the ‘true’ solution
are not known. But many problems do have obvious upper and lower bounds, and in
those cases (as in the consumption example used in the paper), the method may result
in substantial improvements in accuracy and stability of solutions.
